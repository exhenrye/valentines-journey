Recommended layer order (04 being in front of everything and 01 being behind):

01_Sky
02_Skysunset
03_Water
04_Palms

There's two images of the sky, the other one has the sun in it and the other doens't. You can choose which image you want to use. 

You can also use the Combined Background-image as a background if you want to, it is seamless but you can't get the Parallax effect with it.


You can use this background as a part of your games or other projects as long as you remember to credit. Your project can be personal or a commercial one. You don't have rights to distribute this background to other sites. 

Thanks for choosing this background!
