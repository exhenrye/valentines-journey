### Draft Captions by Milestone

**1. Madrid** (October 20, 2017)

> "Our first real adventure together. Wandering the Alhambra, getting lost in narrow streets, realizing I never wanted to travel without you again."

**3. Leavenworth** (October 2018)

Eight years, twelve places, three countries, and one perfect little family. Thank you for choosing me, for choosing us, for building this beautiful life together. I love you more than words. Ti amo per sempre. Happy Valentine's Day, my love."

**Option B - Looking Forward:**

**Option C - Simple & Direct:**
> "You're my favorite person. My best friend. The mother of my son. The love of my life. Thank you for every moment. Happy Valentine's Day."

# Appendix: The Full Story

*Reference material for writing captions, selecting photos, and remembering details.*

## The Beginning: Madrid (2017)

Elora moved to Madrid as an 18-year-old to babysit two girls after a difficult relationship ended—a courageous leap into the unknown. Enea moved to Madrid to study his Master's in Finance (and maybe find a wife).

They matched on Tinder and set up their first date for **October 20, 2017** in the Serrano neighborhood. They almost didn't meet—Elora's phone died and they couldn't communicate—but somehow found each other and went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant.

**First date details:**
- Elora wore thigh-high boots and a cream dress
- After dinner, they went to Bellas Artes (a rooftop bar) and talked for hours
- Enea walked her to the metro but didn't kiss her (she wanted him to!)

**Second date:** Brunch and walking around town.

**Third date:** Cinema, then home together. (That's when he closed. 😏)

## Dating in Madrid (2017-2018)

They dated that entire year in Madrid. Elora spent almost every night at Enea's apartment, and he'd get her Ubers early each morning to return to her host family.

**First big trip together:** Granada—their first adventure as a couple.

## Long Distance (2018)

After the Madrid year:
- Enea graduated and moved back to Switzerland
- Elora moved back to the USA (Leavenworth)
- But they were in love

Enea visited her in Leavenworth after family vacations in Peru. He was living in Geneva, job hunting in finance. Elora was in Leavenworth doing her AA.

**The Surprise:** On October 20 (their anniversary), Enea flew to Leavenworth to surprise her and spent a couple of weeks together. They did Halloween as **Fireman and Dalmatian dog**.

## Geneva Era (2019-2022)

Enea convinced Elora to move to Geneva and live with him—initially in his childhood bedroom at his parents' house.

**2019:** They convinced Enea's parents to get their first dog, **Totoro** (a miniature English Bull Terrier).

**Early 2020:** They moved to their first apartment together at **Route de Chêne 5, Geneva**.

**COVID years:**
- They weathered the pandemic together
- Totoro passed away (very sadly)
- They got a second dog, **Joey**
- Elora studied French
- Enea worked at JPMorgan, then quit to work in startups
- Elora made friends and completed her Bachelor's degree in Sociology from WSU (Global Campus)

**May 3, 2022:** Enea proposed to Elora.

**August 13, 2022:** They married at **Pignora**, Enea's family country house in Novazzano. Ceremony at the courthouse (married by the Mayor of Novazzano), party at Pignora. An intimate wedding with family and friends.

**Honeymoon:** A short trip to Paris with Elora's parents.

## Seattle Era (2022-Present)

They decided together to move to the USA—Seattle—to start a new chapter. They brought Joey, and cats Felix and Cleo.

**Capitol Hill (2022-2023):**
- Landed in Capitol Hill neighborhood
- Elora started working in social care
- Enea continued working remotely

**Ballard (2023-2024):**
- Moved to a skinny three-story townhouse
- Joey had to be humanely euthanized (heartbreak)
- Elora continued in mental health/social care
- They foster-failed **Marzipan**, a Belgian Malinois
- Mid-year: Started planning to have a baby

**Late October 2024:** At Enea's return from a work trip, things got busy in the bedroom. A couple weeks later, Elora announced she was pregnant.

**Matthews Beach (May 2025):**
- Moved to a residential neighborhood
- Cute house with a big backyard
- For Enea's 30th birthday, Elora bought a horse named **Rome**

**July 28, 2025:** The most perfect little boy, **Theo**, arrived.

**Christmas 2025:** The whole family flew to Switzerland for Theo's first international flight. They surprised Enea's extended family.

**January 2026:** Theo turned 6 months old. The family is thriving.

## Looking Forward

Big things are happening. 2026 will be even better.
